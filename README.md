> A curated list of iOS Apps that use Modern File Management

Since iOS11 and – to its greatest extent yet – in iOS13 and iPadOS, Apple has
introduced a number of technologies for [Modern File Management][]. These
include "Open in Place", "Document based apps", "File Provider Extensions", and
"File Bookmarks", and resolve some of the problems with iOS' traditional
sandboxing. Apps that use these technologies tend to compose extremely well and
thus exponentially enhance the power of iOS. This brings especially the iPad
closer to a device that can replace and even exceed the capabilities of a
laptop.

## Glossary of Terms

**Document Based Apps**
: Document based apps embed Files as a part of their UI. This allows to open files from arbitrary Files locations (and third party providers) from within the App

**Open-In-Place**
: Apps that support open-in-place can edit files from any location in Files or from other app's sandboxes via the Share menu.

**File Provider Extensions**
: File Provider Extensions provide a new section in the Files app, as a "third party file provider".

**File Bookmarks**
: Apps that support "file bookmarks" have the ability to open entire folders from anywhere in Files. These are sometimes called "external locations", "synced directories", or "bookmarks".
